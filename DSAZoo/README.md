# Intel DSA Zoo
Intel DSA(Data streaming accelerator), [specification link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/671116/intel-data-streaming-accelerator-architecture-specification.html?wapkw=data%20streaming%20accelerator%20specification),DSA is a high-performance data copy and transformation accelerator that will be integrated in future Intel® processors, targeted for optimizing streaming data movement and transformation operations common with applications for high-performance storage, networking, persistent memory, and various data processing applications.
The project is to propagate the usage to illustrate vector data streaming with DSA (Data Streaming Accelerator) feature introduced in the Intel® Sapphire Rapids platform. It provides an effective data manipulation to demonstrate data move and transforms which can be used by networking, service mesh, message queue, or image distribution.
Here we provide a reference example to use our library in user space network implementation mTCP. The users can use this library into their own network protocal stack.

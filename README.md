# Intel® Vector Data Streaming Library
![](intel-accelerator-zoo.jpeg)
    The project is to propagate the usage to illustrate vector data streaming with DSA (Data Streaming Accelerator) feature introduced in the Intel® Sapphire Rapids platform. It provides an effective data manipulation to demonstrate data move and transforms which can be used by networking, service mesh, message queue, or image distribution.
    Here we provide a reference example to use our library in user space network implementation mTCP. The users can use this library into their own network protocal stack.
